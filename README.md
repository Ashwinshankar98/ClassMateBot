## Basic Overview

This project helps to improve the life of students, TAs and teachers by automating many mundane tasks which are sometimes done manually. ClassMateBot is a discord bot made in Python and could be used for any discord channel.


>**Centralized:** You don't have to use different apps to get all things done.  
>**Easy to use:** Requires writing few basic commands to perform coplex operations  
>**Fast:** Provides instant results for all your queries.

## Description

There are three basic user groups in a ClassMateBot, which are Students, Professor and TAs. Some basic tasks for the bot for the students user group should be automating the task of group making for projects or homewroks, Projection deadline reminders, etc. For TAs it is taking up polls, or answering FAQs asked by the students. 


Our ClassMateBot focuses on the student side of the discord channel, i.e. currently it focuses on the problems faced by the students while using these discord channels.

The user stories covered here would be more concerned about the activities for the channel for Software Engineering class in North Carolina State University for the Fall 2021 semester.

### 1 - Project Voting
The most important task in the upcoming semester that the bot automates is Project Voting which takes place at the end of the month of September and October. Our ClassMateBot allows the student to vote for a particular project which they would like to work on in the coming cycle. This task if done manually could be tedious as the students would have to wait for the TAs or Professor to announce which project they would be getting if voting is done manually. But the bot automates this process and would give out the results as soon as all the students have voted for their choices.

### 2 - Deadline Reminder
Next important thing our project covers is the Deadline reminder feature of our bot. Whenever a homework or project deadline is close the bot itself sends out a reminder to all the students so that they could submit their work on time.

### 3 - Personally Pinning Messages
Another problem that the students face is that they cannot pin the important messages whichh they could come back to if they need so. This could be done through the bot as the students could send in the link of the message they would want to pin and the bot would do that. This way all the students could pin the messages they think are important for them and fall back to them in case they need to.

### 4 - Review Questions
The next feature is that our Classroom Bot helps the students in providing answers to their questions be it regarding, homeworks/projects or on course material or anything else. The FAQs will be answered directly by the bot and other particular questions would then be forwarded to the TA or Profeesor privately and then they decide whether to answer it privately to the sender or to answer it publicly for all the students.

### 5 - Group Creation and Inter-group Communication
Another unique and useful feature of our ClassMateBot is that it helps the students in the process of group making for their projects. Through this feature the bot could help the students to identify other members of the class who have the same requirements and acts as a medium to connect them initially. Afterwards, they can talk to each other in any way possible. This feature is also helpful for times when a person is randomly assigned to a group then the mebers could ask the bot to connect them with the new member and this would not only save time for the students but also, saves effort as many times students do not have their names as their usernames on discord.
